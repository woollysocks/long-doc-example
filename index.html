  	<h1> Overclocked&mdash;When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth </h1><br>
  	<i> By Cory Doctorow (Originally published in Baen’s Universe, 2006)</i><br><br>  	
  	<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">When Felix’s special
      phone rang at two in the morning, Kelly rolled over and punched him
      in the shoulder and hissed, “Why didn’t you turn that fucking
      thing off before bed?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because I’m on
      call,” he said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’re not a
      fucking doctor,” she said, kicking him as he sat on the bed’s
      edge, pulling on the pants he’d left on the floor before turning
      in. “You’re a goddamned <i>systems administrator</i>.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s my job,” he
      said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“They work you like a
      government mule,” she said. “You know I’m right. For Christ’s
      sake, you’re a father now, you can’t go running off in the middle
      of the night every time someone’s porn supply goes down. Don’t
      answer that phone.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew she was right.
      He answered the phone.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Main routers not
      responding. BGP not responding.” The mechanical voice of the
      systems monitor didn’t care if he cursed at it, so he did, and it
      made him feel a little better.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maybe I can fix it
      from here,” he said. He could login to the UPS for the cage and
      reboot the routers. The UPS was in a different netblock, with its own
      independent routers on their own uninterruptible power-supplies.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Kelly was sitting up in
      bed now, an indistinct shape against the headboard. “In five years
      of marriage, you have never once been able to fix anything from
      here.” This time she was wrong—he fixed stuff from home all the
      time, but he did it discreetly and didn’t make a fuss, so she
      didn’t remember it. And she was right, too—he had logs that
      showed that after 1AM, nothing could ever be fixed without driving
      out to the cage. Law of Infinite Universal Perversity—AKA Felix’s
      Law.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Five minutes later
      Felix was behind the wheel. He hadn’t been able to fix it from
      home. The independent router’s netblock was offline, too. The last
      time that had happened, some dumbfuck construction worker had driven
      a ditch-witch through the main conduit into the data-center and Felix
      had joined a cadre of fifty enraged sysadmins who’d stood atop the
      resulting pit for a week, screaming abuse at the poor bastards who
      labored 24-7 to splice ten thousand wires back together.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">His phone went off
      twice more in the car and he let it override the stereo and play the
      mechanical status reports through the big, bassy speakers of more
      critical network infrastructure offline. Then Kelly called.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hi,” he said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t cringe, I
      can hear the cringe in your voice.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He smiled
      involuntarily. “Check, no cringing.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I love you, Felix,”
      she said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m totally
      bonkers for you, Kelly. Go back to bed.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“2.0’s awake,”
      she said. The baby had been Beta Test when he was in her womb, and
      when her water broke, he got the call and dashed out of the office,
      shouting, <i>The Gold Master just shipped!</i> They’d started
      calling him 2.0 before he’d finished his first cry. “This little
      bastard was born to suck tit.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sorry I woke
      you,” he said. He was almost at the data center. No traffic at 2AM.
      He slowed down and pulled over before the entrance to the garage. He
      didn’t want to lose Kelly’s call underground.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s not waking
      me,” she said. “You’ve been there for seven years. You have
      three juniors reporting to you. Give them the phone. You’ve paid
      your dues.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t like
      asking my reports to do anything I wouldn’t do,” he said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve done it,”
      she said. “Please? I hate waking up alone in the night. I miss you
      most at night.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kelly—”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m over being
      angry. I just miss you is all. You give me sweet dreams.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“OK,” he said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Simple as that?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exactly. Simple as
      that. Can’t have you having bad dreams, and I’ve paid my dues.
      From now on, I’m only going on night call to cover holidays.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">She laughed. “Sysadmins
      don’t take holidays.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one will,” he
      said. “Promise.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’re wonderful,”
      she said. “Oh, gross. 2.0 just dumped core all over my bathrobe.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s my boy,”
      he said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh that he is,”
      she said. She hung up, and he piloted the car into the data-center
      lot, badging in and peeling up a bleary eyelid to let the retinal
      scanner get a good look at his sleep-depped eyeball.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He stopped at the
      machine to get himself a guarana/medafonil power-bar and a cup of
      lethal robot-coffee in a spill-proof clean-room sippy-cup. He wolfed
      down the bar and sipped the coffee, then let the inner door read his
      hand-geometry and size him up for a moment. It sighed open and gusted
      the airlock’s load of positively pressurized air over him as he
      passed finally to the inner sanctum.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">It was bedlam. The
      cages were designed to let two or three sysadmins maneuver around
      them at a time. Every other inch of cubic space was given over to
      humming racks of servers and routers and drives. Jammed among them
      were no fewer than twenty other sysadmins. It was a regular
      convention of black tee-shirts with inexplicable slogans, bellies
      overlapping belts with phones and multitools.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Normally it was
      practically freezing in the cage, but all those bodies were
      overheating the small, enclosed space. Five or six looked up and
      grimaced when he came through. Two greeted him by name. He threaded
      his belly through the press and the cages, toward the Ardent racks in
      the back of the room.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Felix.” It was
      Van, who wasn’t on call that night.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you doing
      here?” he asked. “No need for both of us to be wrecked tomorrow.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Oh. My
      personal box is over there. It went down around 1:30 and I got woken
      up by my process-monitor. I should have called you and told you I was
      coming down—spared you the trip.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix’s own server—a
      box he shared with five other friends—was in a rack one floor down.
      He wondered if it was offline too.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the story?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Massive flashworm
      attack. Some jackass with a zero-day exploit has got every Windows
      box on the net running Monte Carlo probes on every IP block,
      including IPv6. The big Ciscos all run administrative interfaces over
      v6, and they all fall over if they get more than ten simultaneous
      probes, which means that just about every interchange has gone down.
      DNS is screwy, too—like maybe someone poisoned the zone transfer
      last night. Oh, and there’s an email and IM component that sends
      pretty lifelike messages to everyone in your address book, barfing up
      Eliza-dialog that keys off of your logged email and messages to get
      you to open a Trojan.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jesus.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yeah.” Van was a
      type-two sysadmin, over six feet tall, long pony-tail, bobbing Adam’s
      apple. Over his toast-rack chest, his tee said CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON and
      featured a row of polyhedral RPG dice.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix was a type-one
      admin, with an extra seventy or eighty pounds all around the middle,
      and a neat but full beard that he wore over his extra chins. His tee
      said HELLO CTHULHU and featured a cute, mouthless, Hello-Kitty-style
      Cthulhu. They’d known each other for fifteen years, having met on
      Usenet, then f2f at Toronto Freenet beer-sessions, a Star Trek
      convention or two, and eventually Felix had hired Van to work under
      him at Ardent. Van was reliable and methodical. Trained as an
      electrical engineer, he kept a procession of spiral notebooks filled
      with the details of every step he’d ever taken, with time and date.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even PEBKAC this
      time,” Van said. Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair. Email
      trojans fell into that category—if people were smart enough not to
      open suspect attachments, email trojans would be a thing of the past.
      But worms that ate Cisco routers weren’t a problem with the
      lusers—they were the fault of incompetent engineers.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, it’s
      Microsoft’s fault,” Felix said. “Any time I’m at work at 2AM,
      it’s either PEBKAC or Microsloth.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in" align="CENTER"><hr></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">They ended up just
      unplugging the frigging routers from the Internet. Not Felix, of
      course, though he was itching to do it and get them rebooted after
      shutting down their IPv6 interfaces. It was done by a couple
      bull-goose Bastard Operators From Hell who had to turn two keys at
      once to get access to their cage—like guards in a Minuteman silo.
      95 percent of the long distance traffic in Canada went through this
      building. It had <i>better</i> security than most Minuteman silos.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix and Van got the
      Ardent boxes back online one at a time. They were being pounded by
      worm-probes—putting the routers back online just exposed the
      downstream cages to the attack. Every box on the Internet was
      drowning in worms, or creating worm-attacks, or both. Felix managed
      to get through to NIST and Bugtraq after about a hundred timeouts,
      and download some kernel patches that should reduce the load the
      worms put on the machines in his care. It was 10AM, and he was hungry
      enough to eat the ass out of a dead bear, but he recompiled his
      kernels and brought the machines back online. Van’s long fingers
      flew over the administrative keyboard, his tongue protruding as he
      ran load-stats on each one.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had two hundred
      days of uptime on Greedo,” Van said. Greedo was the oldest server
      in the rack, from the days when they’d named the boxes after Star
      Wars characters. Now they were all named after Smurfs, and they were
      running out of Smurfs and had started in on McDonaldland characters,
      starting with Van’s laptop, Mayor McCheese.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greedo will rise
      again,” Felix said. “I’ve got a 486 downstairs with over five
      years of uptime. It’s going to break my heart to reboot it.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the everlasting
      shit do you use a 486 for?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing. But who
      shuts down a machine with five years uptime? That’s like
      euthanizing your grandmother.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wanna eat,” Van
      said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell you what,”
      Felix said. “We’ll get your box up, then mine, then I’ll take
      you to the Lakeview Lunch for breakfast pizzas and you can have the
      rest of the day off.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’re on,” Van
      said. “Man, you’re too good to us grunts. You should keep us in a
      pit and beat us like all the other bosses. It’s all we deserve.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in" align="CENTER">###########</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s your phone,”
      Van said. Felix extracted himself from the guts of the 486, which had
      refused to power up at all. He had cadged a spare power-supply from
      some guys who ran a spam operation and was trying to get it fitted.
      He let Van hand him the phone, which had fallen off his belt while he
      was twisting to get at the back of the machine.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey, Kel,” he
      said. There was an odd, snuffling noise in the background. Static,
      maybe? 2.0 splashing in the bath? “Kelly?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The line went dead. He
      tried to call back, but didn’t get anything—no ring nor
      voicemail. His phone finally timed out and said NETWORK ERROR.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dammit,” he said,
      mildly. He clipped the phone to his belt. Kelly wanted to know when
      he was coming home, or wanted him to pick something up for the
      family. She’d leave voicemail.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He was testing the
      power-supply when his phone rang again. He snatched it up and
      answered it. “Kelly, hey, what’s up?” He worked to keep
      anything like irritation out of his voice. He felt guilty:
      technically speaking, he had discharged his obligations to Ardent
      Financial LLC once the Ardent servers were back online. The past
      three hours had been purely personal—even if he planned on billing
      them to the company.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">There was sobbing on
      the line.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kelly?” He felt
      the blood draining from his face and his toes were numb.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Felix,” she said,
      barely comprehensible through the sobbing. “He’s dead, oh Jesus,
      he’s dead.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who? <i>Who</i>,
      Kelly?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will,” she said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><i>Will?</i> he
      thought. <i>Who the fuck is—</i>He dropped to his knees. William
      was the name they’d written on the birth certificate, though they’d
      called him 2.0 all along. Felix made an anguished sound, like a sick
      bark.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sick,” she
      said, “I can’t even stand anymore. Oh, Felix. I love you so
      much.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kelly? What’s
      going on?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, everyone—”
      she said. “Only two channels left on the tube. Christ, Felix, it
      looks like dawn of the dead out the window—” He heard her retch.
      The phone started to break up, washing her puke-noises back like an
      echoplex.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stay there, Kelly,”
      he shouted as the line died. He punched 911, but the phone went
      NETWORK ERROR again as soon as he hit SEND.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He grabbed Mayor
      McCheese from Van and plugged it into the 486’s network cable and
      launched Firefox off the command line and googled for the Metro
      Police site. Quickly, but not frantically, he searched for an online
      contact form. Felix didn’t lose his head, ever. He solved problems
      and freaking out didn’t solve problems.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He located an online
      form and wrote out the details of his conversation with Kelly like he
      was filing a bug report, his fingers fast, his description complete,
      and then he hit SUBMIT.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Van had read over his
      shoulder. “Felix—” he began.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“God,” Felix said.
      He was sitting on the floor of the cage and he slowly pulled himself
      upright. Van took the laptop and tried some news sites, but they were
      all timing out. Impossible to say if it was because something
      terrible was happening or because the network was limping under the
      superworm.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to get home,”
      Felix said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll drive you,”
      Van said. “You can keep calling your wife.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">They made their way to
      the elevators. One of the building’s few windows was there, a
      thick, shielded porthole. They peered through it as they waited for
      the elevator. Not much traffic for a Wednesday. Were there more
      police cars than usual?</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“<i>Oh my God</i>—”
      Van pointed.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The CN Tower, a giant
      white-elephant needle of a building loomed to the east of them. It
      was askew, like a branch stuck in wet sand. Was it moving? It was. It
      was heeling over, slowly, but gaining speed, falling northeast toward
      the financial district. In a second, it slid over the tipping point
      and crashed down. They felt the shock, then heard it, the whole
      building rocking from the impact. A cloud of dust rose from the
      wreckage, and there was more thunder as the world’s tallest
      freestanding structure crashed through building after building.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Broadcast
      Centre’s coming down,” Van said. It was—the CBC’s towering
      building was collapsing in slow motion. People ran every way, were
      crushed by falling masonry. Seen through the port-hole, it was like
      watching a neat CGI trick downloaded from a file-sharing site.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Sysadmins were
      clustering around them now, jostling to see the destruction.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened?”
      one of them asked.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“The CN Tower fell
      down,” Felix said. He sounded far away in his own ears.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Was it the virus?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“The worm? What?”
      Felix focused on the guy, who was a young admin with just a little
      type-two flab around the middle.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not the worm,” the
      guy said. “I got an email that the whole city’s quarantined
      because of some virus. Bioweapon, they say.” He handed Felix his
      Blackberry.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix was so engrossed
      in the report—purportedly forwarded from Health Canada—that he
      didn’t even notice that all the lights had gone out. Then he did,
      and he pressed the Blackberry back into its owner’s hand, and let
      out one small sob.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in" align="CENTER">###########</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The generators kicked
      in a minute later. Sysadmins stampeded for the stairs. Felix grabbed
      Van by the arm, pulled him back.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maybe we should wait
      this out in the cage,” he said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“What about Kelly?”
      Van said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix felt like he was
      going to throw up. “We should get into the cage, now.” The cage
      had microparticulate air-filters.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">They ran upstairs to
      the big cage. Felix opened the door and then let it hiss shut behind
      him.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Felix, you need to
      get home—”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s a bioweapon,”
      Felix said. “Superbug. We’ll be OK in here, I think, so long as
      the filters hold out.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get on IRC,” he
      said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">They did. Van had Mayor

      read this and said, “You don’t know how fast it is, Felix. Maybe
      we were all exposed three days ago.”</font></p>

      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix typed, staring at
      NETWORK PROBLEMS.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a soft phone
      on Mayor McCheese,” Van said, launching his voice-over-IP app. “I
      just remembered.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix took the laptop
      from him and punched in his home number. It rang once, then there was
      a flat, blatting sound like an ambulance siren in an Italian movie.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      No phone service</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix typed again.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He looked up at Van,
      and saw that his skinny shoulders were shaking. Van said, “Holy
      motherfucking shit. The world is ending.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in" align="CENTER">##########</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix pried himself off
      of IRC an hour later. Atlanta had burned. Manhattan was
      hot—radioactive enough to screw up the webcams looking out over
      Lincoln Plaza. Everyone blamed Islam until it became clear that Mecca
      was a smoking pit and the Saudi Royals had been hanged before their
      palaces.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">His hands were shaking,
      and Van was quietly weeping in the far corner of the cage. He tried
      calling home again, and then the police. It didn’t work any better
      than it had the last 20 times.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He sshed into his box
      downstairs and grabbed his mail. Spam, spam, spam. More spam.
      Automated messages. There—an urgent message from the intrusion
      detection system in the Ardent cage.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He opened it and read
      quickly. Someone was crudely, repeatedly probing his routers. It
      didn’t match a worm’s signature, either. He followed the
      traceroute and discovered that the attack had originated in the same
      building as him, a system in a cage one floor below.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He had procedures for
      this. He portscanned his attacker and found that port 1337 was
      open—1337 was “leet” or “elite” in hacker number/letter
      substitution code. That was the kind of port that a worm left open to
      slither in and out of. He googled known sploits that left a listener
      on port 1337, narrowed this down based on the fingerprinted operating
      system of the compromised server, and then he had it.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">It was an ancient worm,
      one that every box should have been patched against years before. No
      mind. He had the client for it, and he used it to create a root
      account for himself on the box, which he then logged into, and took a
      look around.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">There was one other
      user logged in, “scaredy,” and he checked the proccess monitor
      and saw that scaredy had spawned all the hundreds of processes that
      were probing him and plenty of other boxen.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He opened a chat:</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      Stop probing my server</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He expected bluster,
      guilt, denial. He was surprised.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      Are you in the Front Street data-center?</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;

      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      Christ I thought I was the last one alive. I’m on the fourth floor.
      I think there’s a bioweapon attack outside. I don’t want to leave
      the clean room.</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">Felix
      whooshed out a breath.</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      You were probing me to get me to trace back to you?</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      Yeah</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      That was smart</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Clever bastard.</p>

      What do you know?</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix pasted in the IRC
      log and waited while the other guy digested it. Van stood up and
      paced. His eyes were glazed over.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Van? Pal?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to pee,” he
      said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“No opening the
      door,” Felix said. “I saw an empty Mountain Dew bottle in the
      trash there.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right,” Van said.
      He walked like a zombie to the trash can and pulled out the empty
      magnum. He turned his back.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      I’m Felix</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      Will</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix’s stomach did a
      slow somersault as he thought about 2.0.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Felix, I think I
      need to go outside,” Van said. He was moving toward the airlock
      door. Felix dropped his keyboard and struggled to his feet and ran
      headlong to Van, tackling him before he reached the door.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Van,” he said,
      looking into his friend’s glazed, unfocused eyes. “Look at me,
      Van.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to go,” Van
      said. “I need to get home and feed the cats.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s something
      out there, something fast-acting and lethal. Maybe it will blow away
      with the wind. Maybe it’s already gone. But we’re going to sit
      here until we know for sure or until we have no choice. Sit down,
      Van. Sit.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m cold, Felix.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">It was freezing.
      Felix’s arms were broken out in gooseflesh and his feet felt like
      blocks of ice.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit against the
      servers, by the vents. Get the exhaust heat.” He found a rack and
      nestled up against it.</p>

      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;

      <h1> Example questions </h1><br>
      <h2> Hard questions </h2>
      These are examples of the types of questions that you <i>should</i> write.
      <div>
        <p><u>Question 1</u></p>
        How long did it take for the sysadmins to get their machines back online?
          <ol>
            <li> About one hour </li>
            <li> About five hours </li>
            <li>About eight hours </li>
            <li> About twelve hours </li>
          </ol>
            <details style="cursor: pointer;">
          	<summary><i>Click for answer and explanation.</i> </summary>
            The correct answer <mark>option three</mark>, and the relevant information in the text is found in paragraphs 45 and 48, 
            where Felix mentions that he’s at work at 2am when he starts fixing the issue, and then when he finally got his computer back up the text says it was 10am.
            <br /><br />
            This is a good question because it requires reading two separate parts of the text that are two paragraphs apart and therefore the reader must consolidate these two pieces of information in order to correctly answer the question. 
            There is no single sentence that has the answer. 
            In this case, the distractor options are just other reasonable amounts of time that one might guess if they didn’t read the text.<br><br>
          </details>
       </div>
      
      <div>
      <p><u>Question 2 </u></p>
      If Felix had known more about the computer problem when he got called in the morning, would he have still gone in and why?
      <ol>
      	<li> Yes, because the problem was very serious and he needed to physically be there to fix it </li>
      	<li> No, because there were already a lot of other people there working on the problem, but he didn’t know that when he got the call </li>
      	<li> Yes, because he didn’t really care how serious the problem was, he just wanted an excuse to see his coworkers  </li>
      	<li> No, because it turned out that there was an emergency while he was gone, and it wasn’t worth it in the end </li>
      </ol>
      <details style="cursor: pointer;">
      <summary><i>Click for answer and explanation.</i></summary>
      <i> Explanation: </i>The correct answer is not found in any specific portion of the text, but the answer can be inferred from multiple pieces of information.
      In paragraph 8, we learn that Felix considered solving the problem from home, 
      but paragraph 9 makes it clear his attempt was unlikely to be successful. 
      The <mark>first option</mark> is the best answer, because it's clear from later in the passage that because the problem took many people many hours to fix, 
      knowing more about the computer problem would still have led Felix to conclude he needed to go in to the office.
      <br><br>
      This is a good question because it requires the reader to reason about a 'what if' scenario and to arrive at the right answer partially through the process of elimination. 
      While the fourth option may be true in general, it isn’t related to the question of what would happen if Felix knew more about the computer problem; 
      the third option is unlikely to be correct because Felix makes it clear he doesn’t like having to go in to work in the middle of the night; the second option is incorrect because even though people were already working on the problem, 
      those people weren’t working to fix his system.
      </details>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p><u>Question 3 </u></p>
      What kind of relationship do Van and Felix have?
      <ol>
      	<li>They are coworkers who often talk about work together </li>
      	<li> They are long time friends who now work together </li>
      	<li> They compete for similar promotions at their company, which causes tension </li>
      	<li> They go to conventions together but avoid talking about work </li>
      </ol>
      <details style="cursor: pointer;">
        <summary><i>Click for answer and explanation.</i></summary>
      The correct answer, the <mark>second option</mark>, is found in paragraph 43, with a description of their relationship that says “They’d known each other for fifteen years, having met on Usenet [...] eventually Felix had hired Van to work under him at Ardent.”
      <br><br>
      This is a good question because in the distractor options, 
      the first option is correct but incomplete, 
      and the fourth option is only partially correct (they go to conventions together, but we don’t know if they avoid talking about work). 
      So while this question has a direct answer that can be found in a single paragraph in the text, 
      the distractors are constructed in a way that makes it require a close reading.
        </details>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p><u>Question 4 </u></p>
      Why was Kelly trying so hard to contact Felix?
      <ol>
      	<li> She needed to let him know that their dog had died  </li>
      	<li> She needed to let him know that she missed him </li>
      	<li> She needed to let him know that there was a network error </li>
      	<li> She needed to let him know that their son had died </li>
      </ol>
      <details style="cursor: pointer;">
        <summary><i>Click for answer and explanation.</i></summary>
      The correct answer is <mark>option four</mark>, and part of the answer is found in paragraph 64  when Kelly calls and says “he’s dead.”
      Then in paragraph 66, she clarifies that she’s talking about Will.
      The following paragraph makes it clear that Will is their son, but it never explicitly states that, it must be inferred from the phrase “William was the name they’d written on the birth certificate.”
      <br><br>
      This is a good question because the reader must consolidate information from multiple turns in the dialogue between Kelly and Felix and information provided in text to realize that their son is the one who has died. 
      There are also good distractor options in this question, since earlier in the text she called and said that she missed him (paragraphs 21 and 23), 
      and because the text mentioned a network error related to the call many times.
        </details>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p><u>Question 5 </u></p>
      Why does Van need to leave the clean room?
      <ol>
      	<li> He needs to pee </li>
      	<li> He needs to feed his cats </li>
      	<li> He’s cold </li>
      	<li> He is going stir crazy and is acting irrationally </li>
      </ol>
      <details style="cursor: pointer;">
        <summary><i>Click for answer and explanation.</i></summary>
      The correct option is <mark>option four</mark>, and relevant passages are found in paragraphs 142 through 152.
      Van is described as walking around “like a zombie” and Felix has to tackle him to stop him from opening the door to the clean room.
      <br><br>
      This is a good question because Van acting irrationally was only strongly implied in the scene, but never explicitly stated. 
      Additionally, the three incorrect answers work as excellent distractors because each of the three options are things that Van actually says are reasons he needs to leave, 
      but the quick way that the text moves between them and the way they are easily shot down by Felix would lead a careful reader to conclude that Van was just going a bit stir crazy.
        </details>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p><u>Question 6 </u></p>
      What is the most likely thing that happened to Kelly in the end?
      <ol>
      	<li> She died from the bioweapon</li>
      	<li> She escaped with her son </li>
      	<li> She left to find Felix </li>
      	<li> She took a nap to wait things out </li>
      </ol>
      <details style="cursor: pointer;">
        <summary><i>Click for answer and explanation.</i></summary>
      <mark>Option one</mark> is the most likely correct answer.
      The correct answer is not found in any one place in the text, 
      rather it requires the reader to synthesize everything that they’ve read so far and make a prediction about what they think is most likely given what they know.
      <br><br>
      This is a good question because it forces the reader to make an inference about what will happen later in the story. 
      The distractor option in option two is clearly wrong because their son dies earlier in the story, 
      and the fourth option is unlikely given the severity of the situation. 
      The choice between the first and third options can be a judgment call, but all available information in the text is leaning towards massive or total casualty rates due to the bioweapon attack, making the first option the most likely answer.
      The likelihood that Kelly died is strengthened by passages like paragraph 151, which describes the bioweapon as “fast-acting and lethal.”
        </details>
      </div>
       
      <h2> Easy questions </h2>
      These are examples of the types of questions that you <i>should not</i> write because they are too easy, or they are ambiguous.
      <div>
      <p><u>Question 7 </u></p>
      How does Felix get to work?
      <ol>
      	<li> He drives </li>
      	<li> He walks </li>
      	<li> He takes his bike </li>
      	<li> A co-worker picks him up </li>
      </ol>
      	<details style="cursor: pointer;">
          	<summary><i>Click for answer and explanation.</i></summary>
          	The answer is <mark>Option one</mark> and is found in paragraph 10.
            Though this requires interpretation of the idiomatic phrase “behind the wheel”, 
            the question itself is answerable without having to consolidate any information. 
            The answer is just in a single sentence in the text, 
            and multiple later parts refer to his drive in or him being in the car, 
            any of which could correctly provide the answer to this question with a single sentence.
            Further, none of the distractor options relate to anything else in the text, making them poor distractor options.
        </details>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p><u>Question 8 </u></p>
      What does Felix’s tee-shirt say?
      <ol>
      	<li> HELLO KITTY </li>
      	<li> HELLO CTHULU </li>
      	<li> CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON </li>
      	<li> NETWORK ERROR </li>
      </ol>
      	<details style="cursor: pointer;">
          	<summary><i>Click for answer and explanation.</i></summary>
          	The correct answer is <mark>Option two</mark> and can be found in paragraph 43.
            Although the answer choice in option three is a good distractor because it’s the text that is written on Van’s shirt, 
            the question as a whole is too easy because it can be answered in a very simple way by looking at just a limited portion of text. 
            It does not require the reader to make any inferences about the characters or to pull disparate information together.
        </details>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p><u>Question 9 </u></p>
      Where do Van and Felix plan on going to eat?
      <ol>
      	<li> Mayor McCheese </li>
      	<li> The CN Tower </li>
      	<li> The 486 </li>
      	<li> Lakeview Lunch </li>
      </ol>
      	<details style="cursor: pointer;">
          	<summary><i>Click for answer and explanation.</i></summary>
          	The correct answer is <mark>option four</mark> and is found in paragraph 54 when Felix says “I’ll take you to the Lakeview Lunch for breakfast pizzas”. 
            This is a simple, informational question that is not especially difficult.
            Even just doing a ctrl+F search for a word like “lunch” or “eat” will give someone the correct answer without having to read or understand any of the text.
        </details>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p><u>Question 10 </u></p>
      Who is probing Felix’s server?
      <ol>
      	<li> Will </li>
      	<li> A user named “scaredy”  </li>
      	<li> Van </li>
      	<li> Kelly</li>
      </ol>
      	<details style="cursor: pointer;">
          	<summary><i>Click for answer and explanation.</i></summary>
          	This is an example of a question with two equally correct answers.
            Both <mark>option one</mark> and <mark>option two</mark> are equally correct.
            You should always avoid writing questions like this that are ambiguous.
